# TaskEase

A simple todo application with a Flask backend and a Flutter frontend.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, you'll need to set up the backend and frontend separately.

### Setting Up the Flask Backend

1. **Pre-requisites:**
    - Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

2. **Installation:**
    - Install pipenv, which is used to manage the project's dependencies.

      ```bash
      pip install pipenv
      ```

    - Install the necessary Python packages using pipenv.

      ```bash
      pipenv install
      ```

3. **Running the Backend:**
    - Activate the virtual environment and start the Flask server.

      ```bash
      pipenv shell
      flask run
      ```

    - The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
